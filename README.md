# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This guide was created for people in non-developer roles who want to start using Copilot in their day to day.

## Step 1: Install, Update, and Setup Visual Studio Code

Now that GitHub Copilot is available in GitHub.com, you don't _need_ to use an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to use Copilot. However, VS Code offers some customization and functionality that you can't get in GitHub.com today.

If you don't have VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

If you already have VS Code, make sure you update to the latest version:
- With VS Code open, click the `Code` tab at the top left
- Select `Check for Updates...`
- If an update is available, apply it, then restart VS Code when prompted

- In VS Code, let's create a new workspace to work through all of our exercises:
  - Select `File` --> `Open Folder...`
  - If needed, create a new folder so that you're working from a clean slate

## Step 2: Install the GitHub Copilot Extension

- Search for "**Copilot**"
- Click the `Install` button next to `GitHub Copilot`

- In the Copilot panel on the right, select `Sign in to Use Copilot`

- Select `Continue` next to your primary account

## Step 3: Getting familiar with Copilot

- To ensure Copilot is properly authenticated, type "Hello" in the Copilot Chat window and hit enter.

- If Copilot does not respond, or if you see an error, double check that:
  - You are authenticated with a GitHub account that has a Copilot license (click the `Accounts` icon at the bottom left)
  - You have the latest version of VS Code (click `Code` --> `Check for updates...`)
  - You have the latest version of the Copilot Extension (click `Extensions` --> `GitHub Copilot` --> `Update` or `Restart Extensions`)
  - You have restarted VS Code after applying any updates (click the `Manage` gear icon at the bottom left)
 
- Copilot has some pre-defined shortcuts called _**slash commands**_. You can view all of the available slash commands by typing `/help`.

![Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 47 38â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be10b5c5-95d3-424a-9812-985d03067a60)

- Two very helpful slash commands are `/new` and `/explain`.
  - `/new` is great when you need to create many files or a folder structure for a new project.
  - `/explain` is a quick way to have Copilot teach you more about what it generated, or to have Copilot summarize a large block of text/code.

## Step 4: Writing markdown

### Draft with Copilot

Sometimes you know what you want to cover, but not how you want to present it. I find that it can be easier tweaking something vs. designing from scratch.

In these cases when you want to create a markdown outline, try a prompt like this:

```
Create a template markdown file to be used as the readme for my team's GitHub repository.
It should include sections for our mission, what we do, and our team's pictures and contact information.
Include examples in each section.
```

### Reformat with Copilot

At GitHub, I find myself writing _a lot_ of markdown between README's, issues, and discussions. However I prefer to take notes in Google Docs, and copying/pasting between the two can be _really_ ugly.

This is one area where Copilot can really help take the burden of reformatting off your plate.

When converting something to markdown, try the following prompt:

```
Can you convert the following notes into markdown format?
Use bulleted lists, use formatting to bold important parts, and include emojis in titles where appropriate.

<Paste in your raw notes here>
```

## Step 5: Copilot reviews

No matter what file format you're working with (`.txt`, `.md`, `.yml`) Copilot can review your work and provide feedback.

## Step 6: View your website locally

After you've generated some content with Copilot, you should have an `index.html` file.

### Step 7: Create a repository

<details>
<Summary>Click to expand</Summary>
<br>

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. In the top right corner, click your profile picture
3. Select `Your repositories`
4. Select the green `New` button
5. Set `Owner` to your handle (e.g. `CallMeGreg`)
6. Set the repository name to <YOUR_HANDLE>.github.io (e.g. `CallMeGreg.github.io`)

> [!WARNING]
> The repository name must follow this format or you won't be able to make your website public

7. Check the box next to `Add a README file`
8. Click `Create repository`

### Step 8: Publish your site with GitHub Pages

GitHub offers a service called GitHub Pages that can be used to host websites. Each GitHub account can host one site for free.
