# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This guide was created for people in non-developer roles who want to start using Copilot in their day to day.

## Step 1: Install, Update, and Setup Visual Studio Code

<br>

Now that GitHub Copilot is available in GitHub.com, you don't _need_ to use an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to use Copilot. However, VS Code offers some customization and functionality that you can't get in GitHub.com today.

If you don't have VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

If you already have VS Code, make sure you update to the latest version:
- With VS Code open, click the `Code` tab at the top left
- Select `Check for Updates...`
- If an update is available, apply it, then restart VS Code when prompted

- In VS Code, let's create a new workspace to work through all of our exercises:
  - Select `File` --> `Open Folder...`
  - If needed, create a new folder so that you're working from a clean slate

## Step 2: Install the GitHub Copilot Extension

- Search for "**Copilot**"
- Click the `Install` button next to `GitHub Copilot`

- In the Copilot panel on the right, select `Sign in to Use Copilot`

- Select `Continue` next to your primary account

## Step 3: Getting familiar with Copilot

- To ensure Copilot is properly authenticated, type "Hello" in the Copilot Chat window and hit enter.

- If Copilot does not respond, or if you see an error, double check that:
  - You are authenticated with a GitHub account that has a Copilot license (click the `Accounts` icon at the bottom left)
  - You have the latest version of VS Code (click `Code` --> `Check for updates...`)
  - You have the latest version of the Copilot Extension (click `Extensions` --> `GitHub Copilot` --> `Update` or `Restart Extensions`)
  - You have restarted VS Code after applying any updates (click the `Manage` gear icon at the bottom left)
 
- Copilot has some pre-defined shortcuts called _**slash commands**_. You can view all of the available slash commands by typing `/help`.

![Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 47 38â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be10b5c5-95d3-424a-9812-985d03067a60)

- Two very helpful slash commands are `/new` and `/explain`.
  - `/new` is great when you need to create many files or a folder structure for a new project.
  - `/explain` is a quick way to have Copilot teach you more about what it generated, or to have Copilot summarize a large block of text/code.

## Step 4: Write markdown

This one is fairly straightforward, yet very powerful. Instead of writing out long comments or documentation in GitHub READMEs, Issues, and Discussions, you can have Copilot help you as you type by working in your IDE.

## Step 5: Creating your website

<details>
<Summary>Click to expand</Summary>
<br>

To keep things simple, we'll have Copilot stick to programming languages that don't require any additional frameworks or dependencies.

So for our scenario, we'll use the following programming languages:

- **HTML** for the website's content
- **JavaScript** for the website's functionality
- **CSS** for the website's styling

These languages won't require any additional installations to get started.

Let's be descriptive with our first prompt. Our goal is to get something that works, that we can refine with additional prompts.

For example:

```
I want to create a website from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This will be my personal website with a header, a section for my professional career, a section for my hobbies, and a section for my family.
```

## Step 6: View your website locally

After you've generated some content with Copilot, you should have an `index.html` file.

### Step 7: Create a repository

<details>
<Summary>Click to expand</Summary>
<br>

1. Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/)
2. In the top right corner, click your profile picture
3. Select `Your repositories`
4. Select the green `New` button
5. Set `Owner` to your handle (e.g. `CallMeGreg`)
6. Set the repository name to <YOUR_HANDLE>.github.io (e.g. `CallMeGreg.github.io`)

> [!WARNING]
> The repository name must follow this format or you won't be able to make your website public

7. Check the box next to `Add a README file`
8. Click `Create repository`

</details>

### Step 8: Publish your site with GitHub Pages

<details>

GitHub offers a service called GitHub Pages that can be used to host websites. Each GitHub account can host one site for free.
