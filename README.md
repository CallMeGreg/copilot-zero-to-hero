Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a website from scratch through the help of GitHub Copilot ðŸš€

## Step 1: Install, Update, and Setup Visual Studio Code

To get started, make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your laptop.

If you don't have VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

If you already have VS Code, make sure you update to the latest version:
- With VS Code open, click the `Code` tab at the top left
- Select `Check for Updates...`
- If an update is available, apply it, then restart VS Code when prompted

- In VS Code, open a new folder in a location that will be easy to access later, like your desktop.
- Select `File` --> `Open Folder...`
- If needed, create a new folder so that you're working from a blank location

- If Copilot does not respond, or if you see an error, double check that:
  - You are authenticated with a GitHub account that has a Copilot license (click the `Accounts` icon at the bottom left)
  - You have the latest version of VS Code (click `Code` --> `Check for updates...`)
  - You have the latest version of the Copilot Extension (click `Extensions` --> `GitHub Copilot` --> `Update`)
  - You have restarted VS Code after applying any updates (click the `Manage` gear icon at the bottom left)
 
- Copilot has some pre-defined shortcuts called _**slash commands**_. You can view all of the available slash commands by typing `/help`.

- Two of the slash commands we'll want to use are `/explain` and `/new`.

## Step 5: Creating your website

<details>
<Summary>Click to expand</Summary>
<br>

To keep things simple, we'll have Copilot stick to programming languages that don't require any additional frameworks or dependencies.

So for our scenario, we'll use the following programming languages:

- **HTML** for the website's content
- **JavaScript** for the website's functionality
- **CSS** for the website's styling

These languages won't require any additional installations to get started.

Let's be descriptive with our first prompt. Our goal is to get something that works, that we can refine with additional prompts.

For example:

```
I want to create a website from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This will be my personal website with a header, a section for my professional career, a section for my hobbies, and a section for my family.
```

## Step 6: View your website locally

After you've generated some content with Copilot, you should have an `index.html` file.

6. Set the repository name to <YOUR_HANDLE>.github.io (e.g. `CallMeGreg.github.io`)

> [!WARNING]
> The repository name must follow this format or you won't be able to make your website public

7. Check the box next to `Add a README file`
8. Click `Create repository`

### Step 8: Publish your site with GitHub Pages
