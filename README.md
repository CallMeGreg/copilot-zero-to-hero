# Welcome üëã

This guide was created for people in non-developer roles who want to start using Copilot in their day to day.

## Step 1: Install, Update, and Setup Visual Studio Code

<br>

Now that GitHub Copilot is available in GitHub.com, you don't _need_ to use an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to use Copilot. However, VS Code offers some customization and functionality that you can't get in GitHub.com today.

If you don't have VS Code, you can [download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

If you already have VS Code, make sure you update to the latest version:
- With VS Code open, click the `Code` tab at the top left
- Select `Check for Updates...`
- If an update is available, apply it, then restart VS Code when prompted

- In VS Code, let's create a new workspace to work through all of our exercises:
  - Select `File` --> `Open Folder...`
  - If needed, create a new folder so that you're working from a clean slate

## Step 2: Install the GitHub Copilot Extension

- Search for "**Copilot**"
- Click the `Install` button next to `GitHub Copilot`

- In the Copilot panel on the right, select `Sign in to Use Copilot`

- Select `Continue` next to your primary account

## Step 3: Getting familiar with Copilot

- To ensure Copilot is properly authenticated, type "Hello" in the Copilot Chat window and hit enter.

![Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 39 56‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6356229f-21fe-4a3c-be05-a0f572c782a9)

- If Copilot does not respond, or if you see an error, double check that:
  - You are authenticated with a GitHub account that has a Copilot license (click the `Accounts` icon at the bottom left)
  - You have the latest version of VS Code (click `Code` --> `Check for updates...`)
  - You have the latest version of the Copilot Extension (click `Extensions` --> `GitHub Copilot` --> `Update` or `Restart Extensions`)
  - You have restarted VS Code after applying any updates (click the `Manage` gear icon at the bottom left)
 
- Copilot has some pre-defined shortcuts called _**slash commands**_. You can view all of the available slash commands by typing `/help`.

![Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 47 38‚ÄØPM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be10b5c5-95d3-424a-9812-985d03067a60)

- Two very helpful slash commands are `/new` and `/explain`.
  - `/new` is great when you need to create many files or a folder structure for a new project.
  - `/explain` is a quick way to have Copilot teach you more about what it generated, or to have Copilot summarize a large block of text/code.

## Step 4: Draft markdown content

Sometimes you know what you want to cover, but not how you want to present it. I find that it can be easier tweaking something vs. designing from scratch.

For example, maybe you want to create a new README for your team's repository. Here are some prompts that got me to a great outline:

```
Create a template markdown file to be used as the readme for my team's GitHub repository.
It should include sections for our mission, what we do, and our team's pictures and contact information.
Include examples in each section.
```

```
Update the team picture to link to CallMeGreg's github profile picture
```

```
In the team pictures section, change the pictures to a table that also includes columns for their name, handle, and email address
```

```
Adjust the size of the picture to be smaller
```

After just a few back and forths, I was left with this markdown content:

Which looked like this in GitHub:

## Step 5: Reformat into markdown

<details>

At GitHub, I find myself writing _a lot_ of markdown between README's, issues, and discussions. However I prefer to take notes in Google Docs, and copying/pasting between the two can be _really_ ugly.

This is one area where Copilot can really help take the burden of reformatting off your plate.

When converting something to markdown, try the following prompt:

```
Can you convert the following notes into markdown format?
Use bulleted lists, use formatting to bold important parts, and include emojis in titles where appropriate.

<Paste in your raw notes here>
```

For example, starting with a Google Doc that looks like this:

This is what a simple copy and paste into GitHub Issues looks like ‚òπÔ∏è

And here's what it looks like after using the simple Copilot prompt from above ü§©
